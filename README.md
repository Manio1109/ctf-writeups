## 👋 About Me
Aspiring **Junior Pentester** with a strong focus on **web application security**.  
I actively train through realistic labs where I exploit real-world vulnerabilities, chain multiple attack vectors, and document everything professionally.

My goal is to grow into a **professional web pentester / red teamer.**

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned (Real Experience)

Through these labs I have hands-on experience with:

### Web Exploitation
- SQL Injection  
- Stored / DOM / Blind XSS  
- Server-Side Template Injection (Twig)  
- Local File Inclusion (LFI)  
- WAF bypass techniques  
- Authentication logic flaws  
- Password reset abuse  
- Session hijacking  
- CSRF-style attacks  

### Advanced Attacks
- SSRF to internal services  
- HTTP/2 → HTTP/1.1 request smuggling  
- WebSocket abuse  
- Prototype Pollution (Node.js)  
- JWT token forging  
- Reverse proxy misconfigurations  

### Post-Exploitation
- Credential harvesting  
- SSH brute forcing (controlled CTF environment)  
- Privilege escalation  
- Remote Code Execution  
- Internal network pivoting

I want to keep challenging myself by earning more real-world security certifications.  
Eventually, I aim to obtain the **OSCP**, as it is considered one of the toughest and most respected certifications in offensive security.  
This aligns perfectly with my goal of becoming a highly skilled professional pentester.

---

## 🚀 Roadmap

- **More CTFs on TryHackMe** – continue participating in challenges to sharpen hands-on pentesting skills.
- **Hack The Box retired machines** – practice real-world pentesting scenarios and build hands-on experience.  
- **Build vulnerable web applications** – learn how vulnerabilities arise and practice safe exploitation.  
- **Write custom pentest tooling** – develop scripts and tools to perform pentests more efficiently.  
- **PNPT / OSCP (long-term goal)** – earn internationally recognized certifications to validate and showcase my skills.

### 🎯 Career Goal
I am actively preparing to secure a position as a **Junior Pentester**, where I can apply my hands-on skills in a professional environment, continue learning, and contribute to real-world security assessments.
