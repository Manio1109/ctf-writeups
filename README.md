## 👋 About Me
Aspiring **Junior Pentester** with a strong focus on **web application security**.  
I actively train through realistic labs where I exploit real-world vulnerabilities, chain multiple attack vectors, and document everything professionally.

My goal is to grow into a **professional web pentester / red teamer.**

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned (Real Experience)

Through these labs I have hands-on experience with:

### Web Exploitation
- SQL Injection  
- Stored / DOM / Blind XSS  
- Server-Side Template Injection (Twig)  
- Local File Inclusion (LFI)  
- WAF bypass techniques  
- Authentication logic flaws  
- Password reset abuse  
- Session hijacking  
- CSRF-style attacks  

### Advanced Attacks
- SSRF to internal services  
- HTTP/2 → HTTP/1.1 request smuggling  
- WebSocket abuse  
- Prototype Pollution (Node.js)  
- JWT token forging  
- Reverse proxy misconfigurations  

### Post-Exploitation
- Credential harvesting  
- SSH brute forcing (controlled CTF environment)  
- Privilege escalation  
- Remote Code Execution  
- Internal network pivoting
